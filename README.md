# Neighborhood Map Project
Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 5

### Project Overview  
To develop a single page application featuring a map of St. Petersburg neighborhood using .  Add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data ([Foursquare API] (https://developer.foursquare.com/start)) about those locations and various ways to browse the content. The application is built on [Google Maps] (https://developers.google.com/maps/) with [Knockout.js framework] (http://knockoutjs.com/).

### Intructions on how to run the application 
1. Visit my [Github page] (http://qqyoungqq.github.io/p5-neighborhood-map-review/)
2. Click marker to see the name, address, contact and url about each location on the map.
3. Scroll the List View to see the name, category and rating of each location on the map
4. Type in the search bar to find the places you are interested in. Right now I only implement a basic search functionality - search by name.

Note:
Minified codes (using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)) are in master and gh-pages branches. Source codes are in develop branch.
